## Introduction
This project aims to develop a fraud detection model using machine learning algorithms. The model is designed to identify fraudulent transactions based on various features and characteristics of the transactions.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset
- Feature engineering to create relevant features
- Data preparation including preprocessing and scaling
- Implementation of various machine learning models
- Hyperparameter fine-tuning for improved performance
- Model validation and evaluation

## Data
The dataset used for this project is Paysim includes information about various financial transactions, including transaction type, amount, account balances, and more. The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned for analysis.

## Getting Started
To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries and dependencies as mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the code scripts in the specified order to perform EDA, feature engineering, data preparation, modeling, and validation.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Explore the dataset using data visualization techniques to gain insights into the distribution of features, correlations, and other relevant information.

## Feature Engineering
Create new features that can potentially improve the model's performance. This may involve transforming existing features, creating interaction terms, and more.

## Data Preparation
Preprocess and prepare the data for modeling. This includes encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Modeling
Build and train machine learning models using the prepared dataset. Experiment with different algorithms and evaluate their performance.

## Hyperparameter Fine Tuning
Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the chosen model(s) to optimize their performance. This step can significantly impact the model's accuracy and generalization.

## Results
Present the results of the trained models, including performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC. Compare the performance of different models.

## Validation
Validate the final model's performance using a separate validation dataset or techniques like cross-validation. Ensure that the model is not overfitting and performs well on unseen data.

## Conclusion
Summarize the findings, insights, and performance of the fraud detection model. Discuss potential use cases and future improvements.
